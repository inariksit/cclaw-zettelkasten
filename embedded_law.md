# Embedded law


[Genesereth (2015)](http://complaw.stanford.edu/readings/complaw.pdf) gives an example where legal information is important as a part of other applications.

Architects need to design buildings that (a) don't fall down, and (b) comply with regulations. For purpose (a), they can use [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) software, and for purpose (b) they can read law text.

A step forward is <legal_expert_systems>: the architect doesn't need to read pages and pages of legislation or hire a lawyer, but they can use an app to query if their desired door width is legal or not.

If the CAD program provides legal assistance, that's an example of _embedded law_. The same application will tell you if your design defies the laws of physics or the laws of your country.

Quoting Genesereth:
> In thinking about this sort of Embedded Law, consider the metaphor of the Cop in the Backseat. Suppose that we had the benefit of a friendly policeman in the backseat of our car whenever we drove around (or perhaps an equivalent computer built into the dash panel of our car). The cop, real or computerized, could offer regulatory advice as we drive around - telling us speed limits, which roads are one-way, where U-turns are legal and illegal, where and when we can park, and so forth.
