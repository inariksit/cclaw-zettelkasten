# Legal contract

Normative text that describes an agreement between parties.

The parties are bound by law to fulfil the contract. (Even if the contract is [ridiculous](https://www.rt.com/business/man-outsmarts-banks-wins-court-221/).)

Traditionally, a legal contract is drafted by humans. In the glorious future, we'll have <contracts_as_code>.
