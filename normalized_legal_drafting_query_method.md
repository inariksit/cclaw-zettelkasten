# Normalized legal drafting and the Query method (Allen, 1978)

1978 paper by Layman E. Allen: _Normalized legal drafting and the Query method_.

Precursor to rules as code, computational contracts etc. "Normalized" legal document à la Allen ≈ <cnl> with the goal "Improve communication among humans".

### Purpose

Aims to fix _unintended_ syntactic ambiguity, imprecision, confusing turn of phrase or just plain incorrect meaning.
(There are also <advantages_of_imprecision>, which this method would keep.)

### Normalization

(Manually) convert text into two equivalent formats:

1. Itemized list, using line breaks and explicit tokens such as `1.` and `a)`  
1. Human-readable visual diagram. For istance, _if a then b_ is expressed as

    ```
    >─┐
      a
      │
      ˅
      b
    ```

Advantages:

* Exposes <scope_ambiguity&cf> when you need to put things in parallel and be explicit about what is left unsaid.
* Visual graph shows more clearly different ways of reaching a state, etc.

### Query method

Method for humans to learn to draft in the normalized style.

TODO: read that part of paper.
